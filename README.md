This submission uses Java 1.6 and Play 1.2.4. (There were some compatibility issues with 1.7)
I ran the submission in Eclipse, but running using "play run ./scalegrid" from project parent folder works as well. 
If running from Eclipse, please run the command "play eclipsify ./scalegrid/" and then import the project into Eclipse. 

Then ```> /eclipse/scalegrid.launch > Run As > scalegrid```
